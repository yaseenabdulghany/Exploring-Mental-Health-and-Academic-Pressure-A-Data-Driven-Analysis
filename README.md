# Exploring Mental Health and Academic Pressure: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview  
This project explores the relationship between mental health and various demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors in students. Using Python libraries, we analyze patterns and provide insights to understand how factors like academic pressure, sleep, and financial stress impact students' mental well-being.
